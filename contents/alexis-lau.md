Astronomy has been a part of my life since I was in school. Knowing the sky is a hidden treasure, I would like to spread this interest. I have been participated in various events, for instance, introducing night sky to the public and organising astronomical camps for teenagers in Hong Kong. 

The Night sky is what everyone has in common. Perhaps we have tried to take pictures or to identify the stars but no luck. Or we think that only professionals can understand the sky. Many of us still want to capture the moment we enjoyed and keep it as life memories. The presentation will introduce some basics for everyone to get started with astrophotography, mainly focus on landscape and lunar astrophotography, which only requires a camera and a tripod. Software related stargazing and image-processing will also be introduced.
