We live under the influence of the Sun that is actively producing energetic particles through the solar system and affecting the space environments. Fortunately, the Earth is protected by its magnetic field that shields us from space radiation. Under certain conditions, solar wind entries can take place on the Earthâ€™s magnetospheric boundary. In this talk, I will give an overview of solar wind interactions with the magnetospheric boundary and our recent understanding through multi-spacecraft observations.
