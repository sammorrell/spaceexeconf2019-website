I am a Deputy Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office in Exeter. I have spent much of my career in operational weather forecasting. I have also been involved in research into application of satellite imagery in weather forecasting as well as having assisted with training programmes at the Met Office College. 

My talk will show how satellite products play a vital role in weather forecasting. I will present imagery from different satellite channels which reveal the rich variety of fascinating atmospheric structures and processes covering a wide range of scales. By interpreting satellite imagery in conjunction with other observational sources we can, in real time, identify and correct for errors in computer model forecasts as well as adding additional fine-scale detail. This can be of particular importance during episodes of severe weather.
