For centuries, humans have wondered about the existence of planets around stars, other than our own Sun. However, for the first time in human history we are able to find these far away worlds, known as exoplanets. In this talk I will discuss the astonishing variety of exoplanets that we have discovered. I will discuss the physics and chemistry of their atmospheres and recent findings. I will also talk about how to make/find a habitable planet and possible bio-signatures.
