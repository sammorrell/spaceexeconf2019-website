To understand the formation of our own world we need to look to the stars in search of distant disks of dust and gas from which the planets first emerge. Within the structure of these disks we find gaps, rings and bright clumps that are the signatures of the first planets. These systems are so faint and small that one single telescope just isnâ€™t enough, array of telescope working simultaneously is required to image these disks. I will talk about the use of telescope arrays and interferometry in observing the first stages of planet formation in protoplanetary disks and what this means for the formation of our own solar system.
