Astrophysics is without a doubt one of the most fascinating frontiers of scientific discovery, helping us understand the nature of the entire universe using only the patterns of light falling from the stars. Computers aid us in understanding the images we see of space by simulating the lifetimes of photons as they travel through space before reaching Earth, and now we’re using those same simulations to help us better treat skin cancer back here on Earth!

Every day the human skin is exposed to UV radiation from the sun. As a direct result, non-melenoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common form of cancer worldwide. Prevalence has seen a yearly increase of 3-8% since 1960, with over 80,000 new cases reported in England in 2008. NHS skin cancer costs are predicted to approach £180M by 2020.

The gold standard treatment is currently Photo-Dynamic Therapy (PDT), developed as an effective cancer treatment option without undesirable side effects such cosmetic damage. PDT’s mechanism of action revolves around a visible wavelength photon interacting with a photo-reactive drug within the skin, however, currently approximately 50% of lesions are too thick to be treated with the standard protocol – as the photons do not reach deep enough into the skin.

By modifying a code originally designed for simulating light in space, we’re now able to virtually probe beneath the skin to better understand, and therefore aid, how photons travel beneath the skin before activating the PDT drug.

If treatment could be specialised to a patient’s skin type, or even further to a patient’s specific tumour anatomy, an improved prognosis rate is expected. Using our computer code to model the scattering of photons through a model of the skin of a given specific patient, we hope to make improvements on the current standard treatment plan.
 
Here we present the background of NMSC and how PDT is used to treat the disease. We then explore how a code, originally designed and developed for astrophysical research, can now be applied in skin cancer treatment.
