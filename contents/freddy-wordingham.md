For millennia astronomers have been using the light coming from space to study the nature of the universe. Supercomputers can accurately represent this light travelling through simulations, allowing us to to improve the physics and perform direct comparisons between models and observations. 
The same methods developed for these astrophysical codes can be directly applied to helping us better treat skin cancer here on Earth! 
Every day our skin is exposed to UV radiation from the Sun, increasing the likelihood of developing non-melanoma skin cancer; the most common form of cancer worldwide. 

In his talk, Freddy will describe how code originally designed for simulating star formation has been modified to probe how photons travel beneath the skin, and can be used to activate drugs that effectively treat the tumour without expensive, invasive procedures and minimal cosmetic damage.
