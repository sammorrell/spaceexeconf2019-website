I am a senior lecturer with over 15 years research experience in solar and space physics. I study our solar-terrestrial environment. I work with remote and in-situ multi-spacecraft data revealing properties measured on the Sun or in space, and I combine observations and data analysis with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory. My research goal is to understand instabilities, governed by magnetised flows, common to space, solar and astrophysical plasma environments, and to develop the framework for space weather applications.â€¨
