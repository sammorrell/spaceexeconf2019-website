When most people think of telescopes, they picture an optical device used to image distant stars. However, we can, in fact, use the certain astrophysical phenomenon to produce an image, not of the night sky but instead image what is around us.

By using a constant stream of Muons from the atmosphere and knowledge of how these muons will propagate through matter. It is possible to construct an image of the internal structure of objects by measuring the signal of the detector when facing the object. This technique has been used to find cavities in the great pyramids as well as image the internals of buildings.

In this talk, we will learn about the trials and tribulations suffered trying to build one of these telescopes from scratch.
