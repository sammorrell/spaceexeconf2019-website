# About the Conference

One thing we are passionate about as a society is sharing the wonders of the universe with everyone. 
This is one of the reasons we are delighted to announce our first ever day-long conference featuring all things space. 
We have invited some fantastic speakers for the event, including speakers from the University of Exeter, the Met Office and Goonhilly Earth Station. 
We are also showcasing some of the truly fantastic research being done by students within the university. 
We also have a special talk from [John Maclean FRAS](http://www.exeterobservatory.com/) from Exeter Observatory, UK ambassador for NASA's OSIRIS REx sample return mission. 

To keep up to date, please do visit our [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/373831779691152/).
Anyone is welcome to come along for a single talk or for the whole day. 
We look forward to seeing you.
