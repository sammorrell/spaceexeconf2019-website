# About the Conference

One thing we are passionate about as a society is sharing the wonders of the universe with everyone. 
This is one of the reasons we are delighted to be organising a second all-day conference devoted to all things space.

We are working tirelessly at the moment to get speakers together and everything organise. 
If you would like to help out then please do get in touch. 
We will be announcing more information throughout the term.
